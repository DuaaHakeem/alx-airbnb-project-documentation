# Introduction to Project Requirements

Backend development involves creating the server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power a web application. In this concept page, we will focus on the backend requirements for the Airbnb Clone project, emphasizing the key features that make the app functional, user-friendly, and efficient.
The requirements outlined below are categorized into Functional Requirements, Technical Requirements, and Non-Functional Requirements.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Requirements ‚Äì Airbnb Clone Backend

Registration can be done through:
1. Personal email  
2. Facebook account  
3. Phone number  

### A.2 Uniqueness & Validation
Each user account must be unique. Email, phone number, or social media credentials cannot be reused across different accounts.  

### A.3 User Login

- Price per night  
- Amenities  
- Availability calendar  

### B.2 Edit/Delete Listings
Hosts can update their listing information or remove a property at any time.  



## C. Search Functionality

### C.1 Search Parameters
Travelers can search for properties using:  
- Destination  
- Check-in and check-out dates  
- Number of guests (including pets, if applicable)  
- Amenities and specific facilities  

### C.2 Search Results
The system shows relevant results from the database, displaying key details like property photos, pricing, and availability.  


## D. Booking and Payment

### D.1 Booking Workflow
After selecting an accommodation, guests can request a booking.  

**Booking Creation**:

- PayPal  

For card payments, users provide card number, CVV, postal code, and country.  
For PayPal, users log in directly to their account.  

### D.3 Payment Handling
- All payments are processed securely through the platform.  
- Both guest and host receive booking notifications.  
- Airbnb holds the payment until 24 hours after check-in, then releases it to the host.  
- A service fee is deducted before payment is transferred (within 30 days).  


## E. Reviews and Ratings

### E.1 Review System
After a completed stay:  
- Guests can review hosts and properties  
- Hosts can provide feedback on guests  

Ratings include:  
- Overall score (1‚Äì5)  
- Communication  
- Location/position  
- Price/value  

### E.2 Review Comments
Guests can write short comments along with a star rating.  
- A structured comment box ensures consistency.  
- Reviews are stored in the database.  
- Admins can verify and approve reviews before they appear publicly.  

### E.3 Visibility
- Hosts can read reviews left on their properties.  
- Reviews are displayed on property listing pages to help future travelers.  


## F. Messaging System

### F.1 Core Features
The platform provides a secure messaging feature that allows guests and hosts to communicate directly.  
- Conversations remain private between guest, host, and admin.  
- Personal contact information is not shared until both parties are comfortable.  

### F.2 Functionality
- Unread message notifications  
- Full conversation history (even if deleted by users)  
- Real-time chat  
- Ability to share attachments and media  

### F.3 Storage & Compliance
All messages are stored securely and may be reviewed by admin in case of disputes or safety concerns.  


## G. Admin Dashboard

The admin panel provides tools for managing and monitoring the platform, including:  
- User accounts (view, suspend, or delete)  
- Property listings (approve, reject, or remove)  
- Bookings (monitor and resolve disputes)  
- Payments and transaction history  
- Reviews (moderate inappropriate content)


# üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

## 1. Database Management
- Use a relational database such as **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**.  
- Required tables include:  
  - **Users** (guests and hosts)  
  - **Properties**  
  - **Bookings**  
  - **Reviews**  
  - **Payments**  

## 2. API Development
- Use **RESTful APIs** to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.  
- Apply proper HTTP methods and status codes for:  
  - `GET` ‚Üí Retrieve data  
  - `POST` ‚Üí Create data  
  - `PUT/PATCH` ‚Üí Update data  
  - `DELETE` ‚Üí Remove data  
- Use **GraphQL** for complex data-fetching scenarios (optional but recommended).  

## 3. Authentication and Authorization
- Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user sessions.  
- Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with permissions for:  
  - Guests  
  - Hosts  
  - Admins  

## 4. File Storage (Scenario Based)
- Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary**.  
- For implementation, local file storage will be used.  

## 5. Third-Party Services
- Use email services like **SendGrid** or **Mailgun** for sending notifications.  

## 6. Error Handling and Logging
- Implement global error handling for all APIs.  
- Maintain logging for debugging and monitoring purposes.  



# üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements

## 1. Scalability
- Use a **modular architecture** to ensure the application can scale easily as traffic increases.  
- Enable **horizontal scaling** with load balancers.  

## 2. Security
- Secure sensitive data (e.g., passwords, payment information) with **encryption**.  
- Implement **firewalls** and **rate limiting** to protect against malicious activity.  

## 3. Performance Optimization
- Use caching tools like **Redis** to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).  
- Optimize database queries to reduce server load.  

## 4. Testing
- Implement **unit and integration tests** using frameworks like **pytest**.  
- Include **automated API testing** to verify endpoint functionality.
