# User Stories

The user stories define the system’s functionality from the perspective of its main actors (Guest, Host, and Admin).  
They help translate the **Use Case Diagram** into actionable requirements for development.

## Purpose
- Capture what each type of user wants to achieve on the platform.  
- Provide a clear, user-centered view of the system’s goals.  
- Serve as a foundation for building features in an Agile development process.
